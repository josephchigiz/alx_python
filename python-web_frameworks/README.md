# Flask Web Framework Basics  

This README provides an overview of the basics of Flask, a micro web framework for Python, based on code and notes from a learning session.

## What is Flask?
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, known for its simplicity and flexibility.  
It allows you to quickly build web applications with minimal boilerplate code.

## Getting Started
### Installation
Before using Flask, you need to install it. You can typically install Flask using pip:

```python
pip install Flask
```
### Creating an App
To create a Flask application, you need to import the Flask class and create an instance of it:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
```

### Basic Routing
Flask uses the `@app.route()` decorator to bind URL paths to functions, defining what should be displayed when a specific URL is accessed. For example:


```python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Welcome Home"
```

### Running the App
You can run your Flask app as a Python script:


```bash
python3 your_app.py
```  
Or, you can use the Flask command to run it:


```bash
flask run
```

### Debug Mode
To enable the debug mode, which provides automatic updates and interactive debugging in case of errors, run the app with the `--debug` option:


```bash
flask run --debug
```

### Routing
Flask allows you to define meaningful URLs using the `@app.route()` decorator. For example:


```py
@app.route('/projects/')
def projects():
    return 'The project page'


@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'The about page'
```

### Variable Rules
You can capture values from the URL by using variable rules marked with `<variable_name>`. These values are passed as keyword arguments to your view functions. You can even specify the type of variable using a converter:


```py
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    return f'User {username}'


@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')
def show_post(post_id):
    return f'Post {post_id}'
```

### URL Building
To generate URLs for specific functions, you can use the `url_for()` function:

```py
from flask import url_for

print(url_for('index'))
print(url_for('login'))
print(url_for('login', next='/'))
print(url_for('profile', username='Jon Doe'))
```

### HTTP Methods
Flask allows you to handle different HTTP methods `(GET, POST, etc.)` for the same URL. You can specify the methods in the `@app.route()` decorator:

```py
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        return do_the_login()
    else:
        return show_the_login_form()
```  
You can also use shortcut functions like `@app.get()` and `@app.post()` for common HTTP methods.


### Static Files
Static files like CSS and JavaScript are typically stored in a folder named `static`. Flask serves these files at the `/static` route automatically.

To generate URLs for static files, use the special `'static'` endpoint name:

```py
url_for('static', filename='style.css')
```

### Rendering Templates
Flask allows you to render HTML templates using the `render_template()` function. Templates are especially useful for rendering dynamic content. Here's an example:

```py
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/hello/')
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name=None):
    return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
```

### Sessions
Flask provides a session object that allows you to store user-specific data between requests. You need to set a secret key for session management:

```py
app.secret_key = b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/'
```  
You can store and retrieve session data like this:

```py
from flask import session

# Storing data in the session
session['username'] = 'user123'

# Retrieving data from the session
username = session.get('username')
```

### Logging
Flask provides a built-in logger for handling debugging and error messages. You can log messages like this:

```py
app.logger.debug('A value for debugging')
app.logger.warning('A warning occurred (%d apples)', 42)
app.logger.error('An error occurred')
```

## Conclusion
This README covers the basics of Flask, including routing, variable rules, URL building, HTTP methods, static files, rendering templates, sessions, and logging. Flask's simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent choice for web development projects. Explore the official Flask documentation for more advanced features and techniques.
